if you're wondering to search my anti-clip model on toolbox or store, 
this is the link: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/137480715244757/Vitas-anti-clip-system
or
you can download the rbxl file on my github repository.

hopefully, this can help you to improvise your game. thanks for coming! ðŸ˜Š
